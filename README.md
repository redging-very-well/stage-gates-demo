# Stage gates demo


## Example 1 - Preprod and Prod stage gates
This is a simple example where you want to delay deploying to preprod and prod by way of approval from a configured set of individuals or teams.

## Example 2 - Releases with manual preprod and prod triggers
This example works by creating releases when a release has been approved.
Once the release is generated, it can then be used to trigger a deployment to preprod and prod.
